                <p>With the HHS Office of the Chief Technology Officer (CTO), Presidential Innovation Fellows (PIF) jointly pioneered the health tech sprint,
                    "TOP Health," that chose 10 teams delivering digital tools — built with open federal data and emerging technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI)
                    — to improve clinical trials, experimental therapies, and data-driven solutions for complex challenges from cancer to Lyme and tick-borne diseases.
                    The teams ranged from two international teams (i.e. Microsoft Healthcare and Philips Research) to one originally at a medical
                    center that officially spun out into a new company specifically based on the AI clinical trial search tool developed during the sprint.
                    It included physicians and patient advocates as well as data stewards and experts in the relevant domain areas from within government.

                </p>
                <p> The project drew on resources across over a dozen federal agencies and departments. This project represents one of the first instances of a new program that led to new open federal data via machine readable information as defined per
                    the newly signed "OPEN Government Data Act" under the "Foundations for Evidence-based Policymaking Act" (signed Jan 15, 2019).
                    A final demo day will take place on March 1 with cross-agency leadership.

                        Novel therapeutics, such as those under development in clinical trials, are often a
                        treatment option
                        for those patients with serious and life threatening diseases such as cancer. Increasing
                        patient awareness of
                        clinical trials is believed to be a factor in reducing time for participant recruitment,
                        a very large cost categories in
                        clinical trials. Thus, applying AI to help patients find clinical trials studying novel
                        therapeutics, may have the
                        potential to improve patient care and, by aiding in recruitment, reduce drug development
                        costs.

                    <h6 class="text-muted">Contact: Kristin Honey</h6>
                    <p>Lyme disease is a tick-borne bacterial infection that affects more than 300,000 patients
                        annually in the United States-more Americans than HIV/AIDS and breast cancer combined.
                        There is no vaccine and an estimated 10-20% of treated Lyme disease patients fail to
                        recover fully.This work will harness the power of collaboration, citizen science, and
                        data for Lyme disease. The goal is to create digital tools and data sharing capabilities
                        for the prevention, education, and science that will support data-driven decisions and
                        improve public health related to tick-borne disease
